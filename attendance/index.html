      <h2>Evaluating current processes and problem discovery</h2>
      <p>During my time at Rediker software, I got to work on one of the largest and most high priority features in their flagship app, the attendance taking feature. This was a long process of discovery, testing, iterating, and collaboration amongst my team that resulted in a positive change in the new application. After initially kicking off the project, I interviewed several stakeholders that had familiarity with the legacy version of attendance taking. I created some flow charts and wrote a lot of notes to help myself understand the process of attendance taking and the multiple personas and steps involved in the process. I saw how important accuracy and communication was in this process, as attendance can have a massive impact on grading and student promotion.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes and prototype</h2>
      <p>Since attendance was such a well known and documented process in schools, I had a huge amount of insight at my disposal from stakeholders and other coworkers that had dealt with the process. My next step was to take this knowledge and try to draft up a wireframe and prototype, so that I could get to testing my ideas as soon as possible. I went through several wireframe interations with my team before moving onto prototyping in Axure, in preparation for a moderated usability test we were planning. The process began with a teacher marking the attendance in the classroom, which would then get communicated to the office, where the administrators would take action on any status other that "Present". I wanted to use color and as much bite-size info as possible to mark each student's attendance status, as I felt the most important visual signifier was to differentiate the statuses, so the office attendance taker could quickly glance at the list and find the "Absent" and "Tardy" statuses.</p>

      <h2>Usability testing</h2>

      <p>As projects sometimes do, this one unfortunately got frozen for the time being. Shifting priorities pushed this feature back to our Beta release, rather than MVP, so I put the brakes on it right before I began to build a prototype. My plan was to make my wireframes lightly interactive so that I could share with our users and get some insight before moving onto visual design. I made sure to document what I had learned so far during my design sprints, so that I could pick it back up easily at a later time. The knowledge I gained from this project certainly translated to others I was working on in tandem, so in the end it had a positive ripple affect, and we would revisit activity tracking in later sprints.</p>
