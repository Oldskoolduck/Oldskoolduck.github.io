      <h2>Evaluating current processes and problem discovery</h2>
      <p>During my time at Rediker software, I got to work on one of the largest and most high priority features in their flagship app, the attendance taking feature. This was a long process of discovery, testing, iterating, and collaboration amongst my team that resulted in a positive change in the new application. After initially kicking off the project, I interviewed several stakeholders that had familiarity with the legacy version of attendance taking. I created some flow charts and wrote a lot of notes to help myself understand the process of attendance taking and the multiple personas and steps involved in the process. I saw how important accuracy and communication was in this process, as attendance can have a massive impact on grading and student promotion.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes and prototype</h2>
      <p>Since attendance was such a well known and documented process in schools, I had a huge amount of insight at my disposal from stakeholders and other coworkers that had knowledge of it. My next step was to take this knowledge and try to draft up a wireframe and prototype, so that I could get to testing my ideas as soon as possible. I went through several wireframe interations with my team before moving onto prototyping in Axure, in preparation for a moderated usability test we were planning. The process began with a teacher marking the attendance in the classroom, which would then get communicated to the office, where the administrators would take action on any status other that "Present". I wanted to use color and as much bite-size info as possible to mark each student's attendance status, as I felt the most important visual signifier was to differentiate the statuses, so the office attendance taker could quickly glance at the list and find the "Absent" and "Tardy" statuses.</p>

      <h2>Usability testing</h2>

      <p>With some assistance from my teammates on the UX team, I conducted a usability study on the attendance feature prototype. We narrowed down to four main workflows we would have our five testers perform and follow up questions throughout the process. The testing was conducted remotely using screenshare, and we used the Rainbow Spreadsheet template to record our findings and share with stakeholders and teammates. This testing led me to adjust and iterate on the wireframes I had created, as the team and I discussed the results. One of the biggest discoveries we made at the time, was that many school offices had issues with getting updates about teachers recording attendance. They either had manual attendance books that they'd deliver to the office, or their systems were slow to update and would result in them having to call the teachers and ask why attendance wasn't submitted yet. This finding would not only push Rediker to prioritize speedy and accurate functionality with this feature, but also help us understand current process that we could replace with our web application. </p>

      <h2>Visual design and mobile</h2>

      <p>Armed with insight and data from usability testing, it was time to move onto creating visual mockups and documentation for this feature to get built. Using our Rediker Design System, I created some initial concepts in Figma that I would share with devs and stakeholders. My approach was simplicity but high visibility to attendance statuses that needed attention. Mobile was a bit of a challenge but highly important, as sometimes attendance would need to be taken outside of the office, such as when the school was on a field trip or during fire drills, emergencies, etc. Ultimately implementing the first version of this feature was a success and provided building blocks for more specific features to be added, like attendance for class periods and dashboard type features.</p>
